Python-Learning-Project
=======================

A project to help us learn Python!

This is not an application, just a collection of files and examples, the purpose being to:
 - Act as a quick reference guide (the cheat sheet).
 - Demonstrate how to do things in Python.
 - Share useful or interesting code snippets.
 - Learn more advanced features than we would normally use day to day.
 - Learn how to collaborate on a project in Github.

The target language is Python 2.7, because Python 3 isn't widespread enough yet.


###Contribution guidelines:

 - If submitting code examples, stick to [Python Style Guide](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (especially regarding spaces not tabs for indentation, or else copying code becomes a nightmare).
 - Make sure the code is compatible with Python 2.7.
 - Examples don't have to work, they're just examples.
 - Put each example in a new folder, we'll organise it all later.
 - Feel free to add things which are really specific to your work if you think it's useful to someone else.
 - If you can make the example fun by including a Monty Python reference, that's extra kudos!
